- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rachel! A 2nd-year Master's student at McMaster University working with Dr. Ralph Pudritz.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in astrophysical research and numerical methods. I currently research the effects of fragmentation and filamentary feeding on the formation of young massive star clusters. I do this using the code RAMSES, a 3D numerical magnetohydrodynamics codes written in fortran.
